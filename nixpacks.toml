# Nixpacks configuration for Railway deployments
# 
# IMPORTANT: Start commands are set per-service in Railway dashboard:
# - virtual-cofounder (scan): npm run worker:scan
# - orchestrator-worker: npm run worker:orchestrator  
# - execution-worker: npm run worker:execute
#
# Do NOT set a default start command here - let Railway dashboard control it.

[phases.build]
# Skip Next.js build for workers - just install deps and generate Prisma
cmds = ["npm ci", "npx prisma generate"]

# No [start] section - each service sets its own command in Railway dashboard
